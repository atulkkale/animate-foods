# AnimateFoods Animation Project

This repository contains an animation project I created during my training period at my first company for the brand "Fanfoods." The project was built using only CSS animations and focuses on creating smooth, engaging animations to enhance the brand's visual appeal.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with CSS animations, exploring how animations can improve user engagement and brand presentation. Through this project, I practiced a range of CSS animation techniques and developed a deeper understanding of how CSS can be used to create dynamic and visually appealing content.
